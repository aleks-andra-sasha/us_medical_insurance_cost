# us_medical_insurance_cost
This is my first Data Science explorative project, using some Python 3, data visualisation, hypothesis testing, and a multiple linear regression model.

GOALS
- explore relevant methods of data analysis that have been learnt so far within the scope of this Data Science course;
- practice identifying which relevant analysis methods should be performed;
- utilise "Data Science Project Scoping Guide" to gain insight into sound scoping techniques;
- draw reasonable conclusions from the data based on the analysis performed.

CONCLUSIONS
- Smoking was found to be the single most impactful factor on insurance costs between individuals. Trailing in 2nd and 3rd place are age and BMI, which also contribute to an increase in insurance cost, however, nowhere near as much as smoking.
- A non-smoking individual in the age group ’60+’ can expect an average insurance charge of as much as 4 times greater than an individual in the ’10-19’ age group. However, this can grow to be as much as 9 times greater for smokers in the ’60+’ age group compared to non-smokers in the ’10-19’ age group.
- There was no statistically significant difference between insurance costs of male and female non-smokers. However, male smokers should expect to pay on average 2,363.01 USD more than female smokers.
- The number of children and an individual's region were found to have no significant affect on an individual’s insurance cost.
